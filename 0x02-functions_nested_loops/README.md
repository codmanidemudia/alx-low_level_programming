0. Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

1. Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

2. Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

3. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

4. Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islowerto learn more.
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.



Prototype: int print_sign(int n);

Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero

Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero

Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
6. Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.



Prototype: int _abs(int);
7. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.



Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);

Returns the value of the last digit
